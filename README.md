# Working-with-Pandas
1.1 WHAT IS PANDAS?

  Pandas is an open-source library in Python that provides data manipulation and analysis tools. It is built on top of NumPy and provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis functions. Pandas is widely used in the field of data science for tasks such as data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization, and data analysis.
  
1.2 WHY USE PANDAS?

  Pandas offers several advantages for data scientists:
  
  Easy handling of structured data: Pandas provides powerful data structures, such as Series and DataFrame, that allow for easy manipulation     and analysis of structured data.
  
  Data alignment and integration: Pandas can handle datafrom various sources and align them based on common indices or column names, making it   easy to integrate data from different sources.
  
  Efficient data manipulation: Pandas provides vectorized operations and optimized algorithms, which significantly speed up data manipulation    tasks compared to traditional Python methods.
  
  Missing data handling: Pandas offers flexible tools for handling missing data, allowing users to either drop or fill in missing values.
  
  Data visualization: Pandas integrates well with popular data visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, enabling the creation  
  of insightful visualizations.
